title: Solar systems technician
duration: November 2022 - March 2023
details: Installed solar systems in low-income areas. For each project, I evaluated energy demand, determined the path of sunlight, predicted shadows, calculated energy potential, and designed the layout for the solar system to be installed. Completed installation of panels, inverters, batteries, and wiring in several locations. Proudly helped to reduce the cost of electricity and made families less dependent on the grid during power cutoffs.
